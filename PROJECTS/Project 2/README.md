My Project is a simulation of my favorite sphere, space. It’s about an astronaut who is lost in the world to find his/her own spaceship. The mission is to collect the space trashes, find a hidden weapon, fight the aliens and survive from a blackhole. This was an overall view on the project. 

I wanted to have a platform game but wanted to somehow add a puzzle aspect to it. So, I made different stages that each depend on the last one. An impression that the you have entered a maze-like space and don’t know what is waiting for you in the next phase of the game. For example, you could enter the third stage and survive the attack of the alien only if you have found the weapon in the last stage. I tried to use almost all the materials taught this semester but didn’t limited myself to them . I explored p5 reference page to learn new things and include them in my project.

As for the visuals I wanted to have a minimal appearance so I designed my own astronaut and spaceship. For other elements of the game I used circles and rectangles to maintain the minimal concept.  I like a visual which is direct and simple, one that doesn’t confuse the user. I tried my best to give the impression that a user is not only playing the game but also, is a part of the game. I tried to build a close connection with the instructions that are given at the beginning of each stage.
